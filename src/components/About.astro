			Hi there! I’m a lifelong learner with a love for all things language and tech. Over the years, 
I’ve worn many hats in education, from teaching part-time in different IT companies to working as a college lecturer. 
I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes the way we learn. When I started my career, a Smart Board at my kindergarten was the coolest thing available at that time.
Today, I’ve taken my passion for language, technology, learning and art to new heights in the Aviation sector, where I focus on Learning and Development.
